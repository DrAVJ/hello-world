# hello-world
To make a first repo:
My name is Andreas Johansson. I am a professional Math and Physics teacher in Swedish upper secondary school. I am also a phd student in Physics and Physics Education. I aspire to learn and become a Data Scientist and aim to find work to combine the skills and experiences I have gathered so far into value for mine or others companies.
